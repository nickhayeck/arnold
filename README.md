# Arnold: Achieve Total Recall
Wouldn't it be nice if Arnold Schwarzenegger in Total Recall had a command-line application that allowed him to quickly study any topic? If he were born just 78 years later, he could've used `arnold`.

## Why?
I found Anki too heavyweight, has a bad UI, and it doesn't natively support json. This is a simpler application designed to remedy those faults.

## Usage
```bash
arnold deck1.json deck2.json
```
This will open a web interface on localhost.
